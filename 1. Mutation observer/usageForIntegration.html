<!-- When such thing may be useful?

Imagine the situation when you need to add a third-party script that contains useful functionality, but also does something unwanted, e.g. shows ads <div class="ads">Unwanted ads</div>.

Naturally, the third-party script provides no mechanisms to remove it.

Using MutationObserver, we can detect when the unwanted element appears in our DOM and remove it.

There are other situations when a third-party script adds something into our document, and we’d like to detect, when it happens, to adapt our page, dynamically resize something etc.

MutationObserver allows to implement this. -->
